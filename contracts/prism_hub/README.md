# Prism cAsset Hub  <!-- omit in toc -->

The Hub contract acts as the central hub for all minted cLuna. Native Luna tokens received from users are delegated from here, and undelegations from cLuna unbond requests are also handled from this contract. Rewards generated from delegations are withdrawn and redelegated agin and the reflection is applied on exchange rate, and cLuna holders will get the portion of their reward in luna format when they are unbounding the asset.
